            <li>6 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>

            <li>1 tbsp Aleppo red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
            <li>1.5 tbsp tsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground black peppers</li>
            <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
            <li>Eighth tsp cinnamon</li>
            <li>2.5lbs boneless chicken thighs</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p>How to prepare</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Whisk yogurt, garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, ketchup, red pepper flakes, salt, cumin, black pepper, paprika, and cinnamon together in a large bowl.</li>
              <li>Place chicken thigh halves into the yogurt marinade and coat them thoroughly on all sides. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 2 to 8 hours.</li>
              <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
              <li>Using 2 skewers for each kebab, thread half of the chicken thighs onto each pair of skewers making a fairly thick "log" shape.</li>
              <li>Place kebabs on the preheated grill. Do not try to turn them until they begin to unstick from the grill, 3 or 4 minutes. Turn kebabs and grill the other side
                 for 3 to 4 minutes. Continue cooking and turning until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 6 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into
                  the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
              </ol>
